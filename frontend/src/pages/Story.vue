          When I decided to play club ultimate in Montreal, I was selected to be on
          Club Ultimate Féminin Montréal (CUFM)'s elite team, Vénus. With the season
          being super financially demanding, our team decided to organized various fundraisers
          activities to lower the team fees; and for me, I decided to start a store to sell kombucha!
          Before this, I had never made kombucha myself which is why this is not just a store, but
          also a blog for me to share my experiences and recipes with you so you can brew your own batch.

            I am super grateful for my friends and co-workers that kept supporting me by purchasing my fermented foods
            as well as encourage me to eventually build a website. By the end of the season, I was able sell over $300
            various different fermented foods (but mainly kombucha) which is just still insane to me!

            Being in tech, my natural instinct was to build a website to better advertise my product
            and optimize the process of my fundraising store!
